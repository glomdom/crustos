# x86 Architecture

The x86 kernel source code is located in `/crust.asm`.

Register Roles:

PSP: EBP
RSP: ESP

All other registers are free.

For now, this kernel needs to run a Linux Kernel and uses its syscalls
for user interaction and file reading.

It includes the boot source in its data section and makes boot< point to it
at initialization.

## EBP and PS

Here is a schema of PS with `( 3 2 1 )` in it; 1 being the top
```
     ebp>|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|<ebp-4  |<ebp+0  |<ebp+4  |<ebp+8  |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| ???    | 1      | 2      | 3
```

Here is a schema of an 8-byte stack frame in C
```
     ebp>|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|<ebp-4  |<ebp+0  |<ebp+4  |<ebp+8  |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| ???    | int x  | int y  | ???
         ^                 ^
         |-----------------|
             Stack frame
